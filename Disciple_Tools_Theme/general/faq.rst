Frequently Asked Questions
==========================


I Don't See All of My Contacts
------------------------------
The reason that you don't see all your contacts may be that some contacts are shared with you, but you aren't assigned to them. If the contact only shows up under ``Contacts shared with me`` list, then that contact was shared with you and not assigned to you. This does not put them in your contacts list, but it does allow you to get a notification for any changes made to that contact.


I got a Permission Denied message
---------------------------------

    "Sorry, you don't have permission to view the group with id 174. Request permission from your administrator."

If you get a message that says something about "permission denied", then please contact the person who is in charge of your Disciple Tools installation and inform them which person or group your were trying to view. They will then be able to :ref:`share the contact <c-share>` or :ref:`share the group <g-share>` with you so that you can have permission to view the record.


I Lost My Password
------------------
If you have lost your password, go to the homepage. Once there, click on the link called ``Lost your password?``. You will then be taken to a page where you will enter your email address associated with your account.  An email will be sent to this account. Follow the steps in the email to reset your password.
