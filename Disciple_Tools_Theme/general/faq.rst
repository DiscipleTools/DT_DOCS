Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

I Don't See All of My Contacts
------------------------------
 
The reason may be that some contacts are shared with you, but you aren't assigned to them. If the contact only shows up under ``Contacts shared with me``, then that contact was shared with you and not assigned to you. This does not put them in your contacts list, but it does allow you to get a notification for any changes made to that contact.

I Lost My Password
------------------

If you have lost your password, go to the homepage. Once there, click on the link called ``Lost your password?``. You will then be taken to a page where you will enter your email address associated with your account.  An email will be sent to this account. Follow the steps in the email to reset your password.
