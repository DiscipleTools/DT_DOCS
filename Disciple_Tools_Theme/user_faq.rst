The Difference Between Assigning, Sub Assigning, Following, and Sharing. 
========================================================================

Contacts can only be assigned to one person (in this case, 'LD'), and that person is responsible for them. 
The ``sub-assigned`` field, is usually for those who go out in twos, so for example, Sam could be assigned to a contact, 
and Fred goes with him, so is sub-assigned. Ultimately, Sam is the one responsible for the contact. The share button comes in when you want to give someone access so they can see the contact, without giving responsibility.

Create a Contact
================

To create a contact go to the contacts page located at https://[your_url]/contacts/ or by clicking the ``contacts`` tab.  
Once there click the green button ``Create new contact`` located at the top of the screen. Fill out the information and then click 
``Save and continue editing``.

Assign a Contact
================

Go to the contacts page that can be found either by its id or by searching for it on the ``contacts`` tab.  Once on the contacts page go to the ``Assigned to`` section located on the top right.  Click the text box and start typing the name of the person you want to assign to.
Once found click on their name.  The ``Status`` section should change to active, if it does not click on the drop-down and select active.

Edit a Contact
==============

Each section of the contact can be edited.  
The details section can be changed by clicking the ``Edit`` button located on the top right off the panel.
The other panels such as the ``Connections`` panel can be changed by clicking on the field that you want to be changed and editing it there.

Delete a Contact
================

There are two ways to delete a contact. The first way is to go to the contacts page and click the drop-down menu under ``Status``. 
Then select ``Closed``, doing this will bring up a menu asking for the reason you are closing the contact. Once that is filled out the contact will be closed.
Note you can bring a contact back from being closed as it's not deleted from the database.

The second way is to go to the WordPress admin. You can go there either by going to https://[your_url]/wp-admin/, or by clicking on the options button
located on the top right of your screen. Once clicked click the ``Admin`` button from the options presented. Once at the admin page click on the option ``Contacts`` located to the left of the screen. Once there find the contact either by searching with the ``Search`` textbook to the top right of the screen. 
Alternatively, by looking for it through the pages manually.  Once you have found your contact, click on their name. This will go to the contact's database page.
Find the panel called ``Publish`` which is usually found at the top right panel. Click on the panel to expand and show all the options.  
Find the option ``Move to Trash`` and click it. This deletes the contact from the database and can not be recovered.

Share a Contact
===============

On the contact's page that you want to share, there is a button on the top right of the screen with the word ``Share``. 
Clicking on this button will show you whom it is currently shared with. Clicking on the searching filed located on the top of the new panel,
and searching a name will share the contact with the user.

Follow a Contact to Get Notifications
=====================================

On the contact's page that you want to follow. There is a slider on the top right called ``Follow`` with the options next to it being ``No``, and ``Yes``. 
Clicking on the slider will switch between following (Yes) and not follwoing (No) a contact.
