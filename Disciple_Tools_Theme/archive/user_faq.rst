I Don't See All of My Contacts
------------------------------
 
The reason may be that some contacts are shared with you, but you aren't assigned to them. If the contact only shows up under ``Contacts shared with me``, then that contact was shared with you and not assigned to you. This does not put them in your contacts list, but it does allow you to get a notification for any changes made to that contact.
