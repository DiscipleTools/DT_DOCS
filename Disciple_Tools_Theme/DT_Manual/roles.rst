Roles
=====

In Disciple Tools there are many different types of roles. Each role is assigned upon account creation and can be changed later in the admin area. 

* **Administrator**: Users with this role can access all functionality, including the WordPress admin interface. They can invite other users and they can modify the roles of other users.
* **DT Admin**: Users with this roll can manage users and Disciple Tools settings. DT Admins can't manage plugins.
* **Dispatcher**: Users with this role can access all the contacts on the site. A dispatcher is typically tasked with assigning incoming contacts to the appropriate multiplier.
* **Marketer**: Users with this role can create new contacts. A marketer is normally tasked with moderating and administrating any social media and may have the first conversation with a contact.
* **Multiplier**: Users with this role can see any contacts assigned to them as well as any contacts shared with them. A multiplier is normally tasked with making face-to-face meetings with any contacts they have been assigned to.
* **Prayer supporter**: Currently unimplemented.
* **Project supporter**: Currently unimplemented.
* **Strategist**: Currently unimplemented. A strategist is a role that allows leadership to view and think through the statistics and where the coalition is going. He/she is not necessarily receiving or routing contacts.
* **Subscriber/Registered**: A default WordPress role.
