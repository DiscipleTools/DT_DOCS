Contacts
--------

A contact is someone that you are trying to reach. When a contact is first met it is important to add them to the database. To do this use the "Create new contact" button found under the "Contacts" page. More info can be found on the Create_Contacts_Page_. On the contacts page, you will be able to search contacts based off of filters, the default filter is your personal contacts. Other filters include all contacts and contacts shared with me. You can also create your own filters by pressing the "Add new filter" button.

Groups
------

A group is a collection of contacts. To create a new group click on "Create new group," then when the page loads, name and save it. Much like the contacts page, you can search groups based off of filters.  Also, like the contacts page, you can create filters with the "Add new filter" button. For information about the group page goto the Group_Page_.

Metrics
-------

The metrics tab is where you can see an overview of stats for the project.  Upon clicking the metrics tab you will be presented with your personal statistics.  Clicking project then clicking overview from the now expanded subfolder will show the stats for the entire project.
