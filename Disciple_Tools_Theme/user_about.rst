Roles
-----

In Disciple Tools there are many different types of roles. Each role is assigned upon account creation and can be changed later in the admin area. 

* **Administrator**: Users with this role can access all functionality, including the WordPress admin interface. They can invite other users and they can modify the roles of other users.
* **DT Admin**: Users with this roll can manage users and Disciple Tools settings. DT Admins can't manage plugins.
* **Dispatcher**: Users with this role can access all the contacts on the site. A dispatcher is typically tasked with assigning incoming contacts to the appropriate multiplier.
* **Marketer**: Users with this role can create new contacts. A marketer is normally tasked with moderating and administrating any social media and may have the first conversation with a contact.
* **Multiplier**: Users with this role can see any contacts assigned to them as well as any contacts shared with them. A multiplier is normally tasked with making face-to-face meetings with any contacts they have been assigned to.
* **Prayer supporter**: Currently unimplemented.
* **Project supporter**: Currently unimplemented.
* **Strategist**: Currently unimplemented. A strategist is a role that allows leadership to view and think through the statistics and where the coalition is going. He/she is not necessarily receiving or routing contacts.
* **Subscriber/Registered**: A default WordPress role.

Contacts
--------

A contact is someone that you are trying to reach. When a contact is first met it is important to add them to the database. To do this use the ``Create new contact`` button found under the ``Contacts`` page. More info can be found on the Create_Contacts_Page_. On the ``Contacts`` page you will be able to search contacts based off of filters. The default filter is your personal contacts. Other filters include ``All contacts`` and ``Contacts shared with me``. You can also create your own filters by pressing the ``Add new filter`` button. If you need to do a mass CSV import for contacts, go to the Mass_CSV_Contacts_Import_.

Groups
------

A group is a collection of contacts (e.g., a church, Bible study, etc.) To create a new group click on ``Create new group``. After the page loads, name the group and save it. Much like the contacts page, you can search groups based off of filters.  Also, like the contacts page, you can create filters with the ``Add new filter`` button. For more information about ``Groups``, go to the Group_Page_.

Metrics
-------

The metrics tab is where you can see an overview of stats for the project.  Upon clicking the metrics tab you will be presented with your personal statistics.  If you would like to view overall stats for your project, click ``Project`` to expand the menu. Then click ``Overview`` to view an overview of stats for your project. 

Filters
-------

Filters are a way to search for contacts in either the ``Contacts`` page or groups in the ``Groups`` page. There are several default filters included by default. The filter options are located on the left of the page under the heading ``Filters``. If the default filters do not fit your needs you can create your own. More information about custom filters can be found on the Custom_Filters_ page.
Note, you can only have one filter active at a time.
