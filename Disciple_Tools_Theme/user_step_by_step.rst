The Difference Between Assigning, Sub Assigning, Following, and Sharing. 
========================================================================

Contacts can only be assigned to one person and that person is responsible for them. The ``sub-assigned`` field, is usually for those who go out in twos. For example, Sam could be assigned to a contact and Fred goes with him, so he is sub-assigned. Ultimately, Sam is the one responsible for the contact. You can use the share button |SHARE| when you want to give someone access so they can see the contact, without giving responsibility.

Create a Contact
================

To create a contact, go to the contacts page located at https://[your_url]/contacts/ or by clicking the ``Contacts`` tab.  
Once there, click the green button ``Create new contact`` located at the top of the screen. Then fill out the information and then click 
``Save and continue editing``.

Assign a Contact
================

Go to the contacts page that can be found either by its id or by searching for it on the ``contacts`` tab.  Once on the contacts page go to the ``Assigned to`` section located on the top right.  Click the text box and start typing the name of the person you want to assign to.
Once found click on their name.  The ``Status`` section should change to active, if it does not click on the drop-down and select active.

Edit a Contact
==============

Each section of the contact can be edited.  
The details section can be edited by clicking the ``Edit`` button located on the top right off the panel.
The other panels, such as the ``Connections`` panel, can be edited by clicking on the field that you want to edit.

Delete a Contact
================

There are two ways to delete a contact. The first way is to go to the contacts page and click the drop-down menu under ``Status``. 
Then, select ``Closed``. Doing this will bring up a menu asking for the reason you are closing the contact. Once that is filled out the contact will be closed.
Note, you can re-open a contact since it's not deleted from the database.

The second way to delete a contact is from within the WordPress admin. You can go there either by going to https://[your_url]/wp-admin/ or by clicking on the ``Settings`` icon
located at the top right of your screen. Once clicked, click the ``Admin`` button from the options presented. Then at the admin page click on the option ``Contacts`` located to the left of the screen. You can find the contact either by searching with the ``Search`` bar at the top right of the screen. 
Alternatively, you can search for it through the pages manually.  Once you have found your contact, click on their name. This will go to the contact's database page.
Find the panel called ``Publish``, which is usually on the upper right. Click on the panel to expand and show all the options.  
Find the option ``Move to Trash`` and click it. This deletes the contact from the database and can not be recovered.

Share a Contact
===============

On the contact's page that you want to share, there is a button on the top right of the screen with the word ``Share``. 
Clicking on this button will show you with whom it is currently shared. If you want to share this contact, click on the ``Search Users`` field and begin typing their name. Then, click on the name of the person you want to share that contact with.

Follow a Contact to Get Notifications
=====================================

On the contact's page that you want to follow there is a slider on the top right called ``Follow`` with the options next to it being ``No``, and ``Yes``.  Clicking on the slider will toggle it between following (Yes) and not follwoing (No) the contact.

Lost Your Password
==================

If you have lost your password, go to the homepage. Once there, click on the link called ``Lost your password?``. You will then be taken to a page where you will enter your email address associated with your account.  An email will be sent to this account. Follow the steps in the email to reset your password.

I Can't Write My Own Custom Reason for the Contact Being Closed
=============================================================== 

This is currently not a feature. Instead, you can select ``Unknown`` and then write a comment in the comments panel with the reason why the contact is closed.

I Don't See All of My Contacts
==============================
 
The reason may be that some contacts are shared with you, but you aren't assigned to them. If the contact only shows up under ``Contacts shared with me``, then that contact was shared with you and not assigned to you. This does not put them in your contacts list, but it does allow you to get a notification for any changes made to that contact.
