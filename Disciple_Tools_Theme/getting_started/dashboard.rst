|Dashboard Page|

Active Contacts Tile
====================
The number of your active contacts is displayed in the circle. There are also a buttons to ``Add a contact`` and ``View Contact List``.

Pending Contacts Tiles
======================
If you have one or more pending contacts that need to be accepted, then these will be listed here. Next to each contact will be the option to ``Accept`` or ``Decline``. At the bottom of the tile the button ``View All`` will take you to a filtered list of contacts that need to be accepted or declined.

Update Needed Tile
==================
When you have some contacts that have not been updated for a while, the system will alert you of this and list those contacts in this tile. By clicking on the name of the contact, you can go to their contact record and make an entry to update them.

At the bottom of the tile the button ``View All`` will take you to a filtered list of contacts that need to be updated.

Contact Workload Tile
=====================
As it says, "Choose an option to let the dispatcher(s) know if you are ready for new contacts". There are three options.

1. Accepting new contacts - You are happy to get offered more contacts to follow up with.

2. I'm only investing in existing contacts - You are not wanting new contacts because you already have enough.

3. I have too many contacts - You have too many contacts already so you won't be offered more.


Set travel or dates unavailable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the bottom of the tile is a link to ``Set travel or dates unavailable``. Clicking here will take you to the area in your ``Settings > Availability`` where you can set and adjust your :ref:`availability information <set-availability>`.
