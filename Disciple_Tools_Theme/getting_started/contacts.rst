Contacts
********

A contact represents a person who is on a spiritual journey. It is someone we pray will discover, share, and obey Christ, start churches, and multiply themselves generationally.

The Contacts Page is made up of two layers: The Contacts List Page and the Contact Record Page.

You can create new contacts and edit existing ones. If you need to do a mass CSV import for contacts, click `here <https://disciple-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Disciple_Tools_Theme/archive/user_mass_contacts_csv_import.html>`_ to check out the step by step guide.

responsible for assigning new contacts to be coached) can see them. Learn more about the Disciple.Tools `roles`_ and their varying permission levels..

The default filter options are located on the left of the page under the heading ``Filters``. By clicking these, your list of contacts will change.

|Filters|

**The Default Filters are:**

* **All contacts:** Certain roles, such as Admin and Dispatcher, in Disciple.Tools allow you to view all contacts in your Disciple.Tools system. Other roles such as Multipliers will only see their contacts and contacts shared with them under ``All contacts``.

* **My Contacts:** All contacts you personal create or have been assigned to you, can be found under ``My Contacts``.

  + Newly Assigned: These are contacts who have been assigned to you but you have not accepted yet
  + Assignment Needed: These are contacts that the Dispatcher still needs to assign to a Multiplier
  + Update Needed: These are contacts in need of an update about their progress so none fall through the cracks. This can be manually requested by a Dispatcher or automatically set based on time (e.g. No activity after 2 months).
  + Meeting Scheduled: These are all contacts with whom you have scheduled a meeting but have not yet met.
  + Contact Attempt Needed: These are contacts who you have accepted but have not yet made the first attempt to contact them.


* **Contacts shared with me:** These are all contacts who other users have shared with you. You do not have responsibility for these contacts but you can access them and comment if needed.
