Users
=====


Only Users with the role `DT Admin` can manage other users. Managing users includes inviting, creating, updating and deleting users.

Inviting Users
--------------
Here is how you invite someone to be a user within Disciple.Tools

1. Open the wp-admin page by clicking ``Admin`` from the Settings |Gear| in the top right of the page

2. Click the ``Users`` tab on the left. Next click ``Add New``. 

3. Here you might have one option ( Add New User ), or you might have two options ( Add Existing User and Add New User ).

**Add Existing User**
If you have the Add Existing User option, enter the email address and see if the user already exists. 

**Add New User**
If the user does not already exist or you only have Add New User option, fill out the required info and click the ```Add New User`` button. To learn more about Roles see `Roles`_.

In either case: If there is already a Contact Record in your Disciple.Tools system that represents the user you want to add, then search for that cantact's name in the ``Corresponds to Contact`` box. If the user is already a contact in the system see the section "Inviting a user from a contact" below.




Inviting a user from a Contact Record
------------------------------------
If there is already a contact for the user you want to add, there is an easy option. In the Contact Record, click the ``Dispatcher actions`` menu in the top bar then click the ``Make a user from this contact`` option.


Linking an existing contact to a user
--------------------------------------
If you realize that you have a contact that should be linked with a user account, then in the Contact Record click the ``Dispatcher actions`` menu in the top bar and then the ``Link to an existing user`` option.
