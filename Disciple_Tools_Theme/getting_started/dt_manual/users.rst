Users
=====


Only Users with the role `DT Admin` can manage other users. Managing users inclues inviting, creating, updating and deleting users.

Inviting Users
--------------
Here is how you invite someone to be a user and D.T. Open the wp admin page ( by clicking admin from the settings gear in the top right).
Next click the users tab on the left. Next click ``Add New``. 

Here you might have one option ( Add New User ), or you might have two ( Add Existing User and Add New User ).
If you have the Add Existing User option, enter the email address and see if the user already exists. 

If the user does not already exist or you only have one option fill out the required info and click the ```Add New User`` button. For the Roles option see `Roles`_.

In either case: If there is already a contact in the system that represents the user you want to add, then search for that cantact's name in the 
``Corresponds to Contact`` box.


Note: in the case the user is already a contact in the system see the section "Inviting a user from a contact" below.


Inviting a user from a contact
------------------------------
If there is already a contact for the user you want to add there is an easy option. On the contact record click the ``tools`` menu in the top bar then the ``Make a user from this contact`` option.


Linking and existing contact to a user
--------------------------------------
If you realize that you have a contact the should be linked with a user, then on the contact record click the ``tools`` menu in the top bar and then the ``Link to an existing user`` option.
