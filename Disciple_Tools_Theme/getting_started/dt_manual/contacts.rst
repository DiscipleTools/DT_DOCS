Contacts
********

A contact is someone that you are trying to reach. You can create new contacts and edit existing ones. For a step by step guide on creating new contacts, `go here <https://disciple-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Disciple_Tools_Theme/user_step_by_step.html#create-a-contact>`_. On the ``Contacts`` page you will be able to search contacts based off of filters. The default filter is your personal contacts. Other filters include ``All contacts`` and ``Contacts shared with me``. You can also create your own filters by pressing the |ADD-FILTER| button. If you need to do a mass CSV import for contacts, check out the step by step `here <https://disciple-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Disciple_Tools_Theme/user_step_by_step.html#mass-contacts-csv-import>`_.

Filters
--------

Filters are a way to search for contacts in either the ``Contacts List`` page or groups in the ``Groups List`` page. There are several default filters included by default. The filter options are located on the left of the page under the heading ``Filters``. If the default filters do not fit your needs you can create your own. 

**All contacts**
Certain roles, such as Admin and Dispatcher, in Disciple.Tools allow you to view all contacts in your Disciple.Tools system. Other roles such as Multipliers will only see their contacts and contacts shared with them under ``All contacts``.

**My Contacts**
All contacts you personal create or have been assigned to you, can be found under ``My Contacts``.

**Contacts shared with me**
These are contacts that other users have shared with you.

.. note:: You can only have one filter active at a time.

Contacts Profile Page
=====================

Assign a Contact
----------------

Go to the contact's page that can be found either by its id or by searching for it on the ``contacts`` tab.  Once on the contact's page, go to the ``Assigned to`` section located on the top right.  Click the text box and start typing the name of the person you want to assign to.
Once found click on their name.  The ``Status`` section should change to active, if it does not click on the drop-down and select active.

Edit a Contact
--------------

Each section of the contact can be edited.  
The details section can be edited by clicking the ``Edit`` button located on the top right off the panel.
The other panels, such as the ``Connections`` panel, can be edited by clicking on the field that you want to edit.

Delete a Contact
----------------

There are two ways to delete a contact. The first way is to go to the contacts page and click the drop-down menu under ``Status``. 
Then, select ``Closed``. Doing this will bring up a menu asking for the reason you are closing the contact. Once that is filled out the contact will be closed.
Note, you can re-open a contact since it's not deleted from the database.

The second way to delete a contact is from within the WordPress admin. You can go there either by going to https://[your_url]/wp-admin/ or by clicking on the ``Settings`` icon
located at the top right of your screen. Once clicked, click the ``Admin`` button from the options presented. Then at the admin page click on the option ``Contacts`` located to the left of the screen. You can find the contact either by searching with the ``Search`` bar at the top right of the screen. 
Alternatively, you can search for it through the pages manually.  Once you have found your contact, click on their name. This will go to the contact's database page.
Find the panel called ``Publish``, which is usually on the upper right. Click on the panel to expand and show all the options.  
Find the option ``Move to Trash`` and click it. This deletes the contact from the database and can not be recovered.

Share a Contact
---------------

On the contact's page that you want to share, there is a button on the top right of the screen with the word ``Share``. 
Clicking on this button will show you with whom it is currently shared. If you want to share this contact, click on the ``Search Users`` field and begin typing their name. Then, click on the name of the person you want to share that contact with.

Follow a Contact to Get Notifications
-------------------------------------

On the contact's page that you want to follow there is a slider on the top right called ``Follow`` with the options next to it being ``No``, and ``Yes``.  Clicking on the slider will toggle it between following (Yes) and not follwoing (No) the contact.
