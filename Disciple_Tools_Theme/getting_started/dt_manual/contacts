Contacts
=======

A contact is someone that you are trying to reach. You can create new contacts and edit existing ones. For a step by step guide on creating new contacts, `go here <https://disciple-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Disciple_Tools_Theme/user_step_by_step.html#create-a-contact>`_. On the ``Contacts`` page you will be able to search contacts based off of filters. The default filter is your personal contacts. Other filters include ``All contacts`` and ``Contacts shared with me``. You can also create your own filters by pressing the |ADD-FILTER| button. If you need to do a mass CSV import for contacts, check out the step by step `here <https://disciple-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Disciple_Tools_Theme/user_step_by_step.html#mass-contacts-csv-import>`_.
