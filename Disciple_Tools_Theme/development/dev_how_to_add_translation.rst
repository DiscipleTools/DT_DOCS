How to Add a Translation
================================

Overview
-----------

Disciple.Tools is build on Wordpress and uses the Wordpress translation strategy. Extensive resourses can be found on
`Wordpress.org <https://wordpress.org>`_ giving explainations and help for translators. `Wordpress Translation Resources <https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/>`_

We invite you to contribute a new translation to Disciple.Tools and it does not require writing code! You can submit
completed translations through Github or through email, and our commit team will review it and add it to the project.

Resources You Need
-------

 1. Download `Disciple Tools template file (.pot) <https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-theme/blob/master/dt-assets/translation/disciple_tools.pot>`_ or a current translation file ({language_code}.po). Scan the `github translations folder <https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-theme/tree/master/dt-assets/translation>`_ for the file for which you are looking.

 2. Download and install `POEdit <https://poedit.net/download>`_ free translation software.

How To Setup POEdit
-------

 1. Open POEdit.
 2. Go to File and select `New from POT/PO File...`
 3. Select .pot file or .po file that you downloaded. (see section above)
 4. Once file is loaded, you will see the original English translation on the left and space for the new translation in the column on the right.

 .. note:: Notice the number of translation strings at the bottom bar. This tells you how many strings are to be translated and how many are left to be translated.

Submitting Finished Translation
-------

When you save your translation file, the POEdit software will create two files (.po and .mo). We need both of these files.

**Submit through Github**

 1. Take the .po and .mo files and create a .zip archive.
 2. Go to the `issues on the Disciple Tools Github project <https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-theme/issues>`_ (make sure you are signed into Github).
 3. Create a new issue and attach .zip file, which contains the .po and .mo, to the issue.
