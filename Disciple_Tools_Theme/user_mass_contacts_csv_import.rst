========================
Mass Contacts CSV Import
========================

To import contacts with a CSV file you must first have a CSV file to import.  
For the csv file the format is as follows; [``Name``], [``Contact Phone``], [``Contact Email``], [``Contact Address``], [``Gender``], [``Notes``].
If you can't fill a space then leave it blank. ``Notes`` will take all of the remaining columns after gender.

Once you have the file, go to your ``admin page``. Next,  click on ``Extensions`` on the left menu. Then click on the ``Tools`` tab. 
You will then see the option for CSV import. Click ``upload file``, then upload your file. Select your ``delimiter`` (by default ``,``), ``header`` (if the first line has contact info or not), and which source all these contacts are coming from. Then choose a user to assign it to.

Clicking  ``submit`` will bring you to a validation page. This will show you the first contact that you will create 
(Note that the notes tab will only show the first note). If it looks correct, click ``Yes``. Then your contacts will be created. 

Note: Depending on the size of the import, it may take some time.
