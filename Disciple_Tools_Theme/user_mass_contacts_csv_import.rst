========================
Mass Contacts CSV Import
========================

To import contacts with a CSV file you must first have a CSV file to import.  
For the csv file the format is as follows; [``Name``], [``Contact Phone``], [``Contact Email``], [``Contact Address``], [``Gender``], [``Notes``].
If you can't fill a space then leave it blank. For notes it will take all of the remaining columns after contact email.

Once you have the file go to your ``admin page`` then go to the tab ``Extensions``. Once there click on the ``Tools`` tab. 
You will then see the option for CSV import. Click ``upload file`` then upload your file. Select your ``delimiter`` (by default ``,``),
select which source all these contacts are coming from. Then choose a user to assign it to.

Clicking  ``submit`` will bring you to a validation page. This will show you the first contact that you will create 
(Note that the notes tab will only show the first note). If it looks correct click ``Yes``. Then your contacts will be created. NOTE DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE IMPORT IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME.
