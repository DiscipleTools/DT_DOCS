# DT_DOCS
This is the GitHub page for the docs of Disciple Tools.  The docs are hosted on https://disciple-tools.readthedocs.io.

# Tools
We use [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html) to make the docs. The pages are formatted with .rst (reStructuredText), the docs for this is found [here](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html).

# Structure

The docs are structured as follows. The [index.rst](index.rst) page is the home page for the entire docs, and it links to all the projects. Each project will house the doc files in a folder, in the folder the home doc will be the folder name plus the words index.  For each project, we will write docs for users and developers. When writing a doc for either of them, preface either user_ or dev_ before the doc name to tell them apart.
